Development process
-------------------

:doc:`Read this overview <gitwash/index>` of how to use Git with
``scikits.image``.  Here's the long and short of it:

 * Go to `http://github.com/stefanv/scikits.image
   <http://github.com/stefanv/scikits.image>`_  and follow the instructions on
   making your own fork/branch.
 * Make changes to your branch, committing locally as you progress.
 * Push your changes back to github.
 * Ping stefan to request a merge into the main development branch.

.. note::

   Do *not* merge the main branch into yours.  You may rebase,
   as long as you are `aware of its dangers <http://tinyurl.com/lll385>`_
   (also see `LWN article <http://tinyurl.com/nqcbkj>`_).

All of this may be intimidating if you've never used git before, so we'd
happily accept plain old unified diffs (``git diff`` or ``diff -u a.txt
b.txt``) as well.

Guidelines
``````````
 * All code should have tests (see "Test coverage" below for more details).
 * All code should be documented, to the same
   `standard <http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
   as NumPy and SciPy.
 * Follow the `Python PEPs <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
   where possible.
 * All major changes should be `posted for review
   <http://codereview.appspot.com>`_ to the `mailing list
   <http://groups.google.com/group/scikits-image>`_.

Test coverage
`````````````
Tests for a module should ideally cover all code in that module, i.e. statement
coverage should be at 100%. To measure the test coverage, install `<coverage.py
http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ and then run::

  $ make coverage

This will print a report with one line for each file in `scikits.image`,
detailing the test coverage::

  Name                                             Stmts   Exec  Cover   Missing
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  scikits/image/color/colorconv                       77     77   100%
  scikits/image/filter/__init__                        1      1   100%
  ...
